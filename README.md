1. Correlation Heatmap and Bar Chart

A correlation heatmap was created from the given features.csv file. 
The variables in the file were taken and the correlation between each variable was mapped onto the heatmap.
Darker colors on the heatmap represents stronger negative correlations; on the other hand, lighter colors on the heatmap represents stronger positive correlations between variables.
The full heatmap can be seen on FULL_correlation_heatmap.png in the repository as well as the Data_Analysis.ipynb.

In addition, two bar charts were created to highlight the top 5 most positively correlated variables and the top 5 negatively correlated variables.
These charts are available on the head_correlation_bar_chart.png and tail_correlation_bar_chart.png files. The graphs can be more clearly viewed on the Jupyter Notebook file: Data_Analysis.ipynb.
